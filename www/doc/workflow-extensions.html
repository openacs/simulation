<h2>Timers</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Use cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    A student has one week to send a document to another role. If
    he/she fails to do so, a default action executes.
  </li>
  <li>
    An OpenACS OCT member has one week to vote on a TIP. If he/she does not
    vote within that week, a default "Abstain" action is executed.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The timer will always be of the form "This action will automatically
  execute x number of seconds after it becomes enabled". If it is
  later un-enabled (disabled) because another action (e.g. a vote
  action in the second use casae above) was executed, then the timer
  will be reset. If the action later becomes enabled, the timer will start 
  anew.
</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>
  We currently do not have any information on which actions are
  enabled, and when they're enabled. We will probably need a table,
  perhaps one just for timed actions, in which a row is created when a
  timed action is enabled, and the row is deleted again when the state
  changes.
</p>

<h4>Extending workflow_actions:</h4>

<pre>
create table workflow_case_timed_actions(
    ...
    -- The number of seconds after having become enabled the action
    -- will automatically execute
    timeout_seconds         integer
    ...
);
</pre>

<h4>The table:</h4>

<pre>
create table workflow_case_timed_actions(
    case_id                 integer
                            constraint wf_case_time_act_case_id_nn
                            not null
                            constraint wf_case_time_act_case_id_fk
                            references workflow_cases(case_id)
                            on delete cascade,
    action_id               integer
                            constraint wf_case_time_act_action_id_nn
                            not null
                            constraint wf_case_time_act_action_id_fk
                            references workflow_actions(action_id)
                            on delete cascade,
    -- the timestamp when this action fires
    fire_timestamp          timestamp
                            constraint wf_case_time_act_timeout_nn
                            not null,
    constraint workflow_case_timed_actions_pk
    primary key (case_id, action_id)
);
</pre>

<h4>The logic:</h4>

<p>
  After executing an action, <code>workflow::case::action::execute</code> will:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Delete all actions from <code>worklfow_case_timed_actions</code> which are no longer enabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Insert a row for all enabled actions with timeouts which are not
    already in <code>workflow_case_timed_actions</code>, with
    <code>fire_timestamp = current_timestamp + workflow_actions.timeout_seconds</code> .
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the sweeper immediately, so if timeout_seconds is
    zero (automatic action), the action will execute right away, and
    not at the next sweep.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>The sweeper</h4>

<p>
  The sweeper will find rows in
  <code>workflow_case_timed_actions</code> with <code>fire_timetsamp <
  current_timestamp</code>, order by fire_timstamp, and execute them.
</p>

<p>
  It should do a query to find the action to fire first, then release
  the db-handle and execute it. Then do a fresh query to find the
  next, etc. That way we will handle the situation correctly where the
  first action firing causes the second action to no longer be
  enabled.
</p>

<h4>The Optimization</h4>

<p>
  Every time the sweeper runs, at least one DB query will be made,
  even if there are no timed actions to be executed.
</p>

<p>
  Possible optimizations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    When keep an NSV with the timestamp (in [clock seconds] format)
    and (case_id, action_id) of the first action to fire. That way,
    the sweeper need not hit the DB at all most of the time.  When a
    new timed action is inserted, we compare with the NSV, and update
    if the new action fires before the old action. When the timed
    action referred to in the NSV is either deleted because it gets
    un-enabled, or executed, we'll clear the NSV, causing the next hit
    to the sweeper to execute the query to find the (case_id,
    action_id, fire_timestamp) of the first action to fire. Finally,
    we would need an NSV value to represent the fact that there are no
    rows in this table, so we don't keep executing the query in that
    case.
  </li>
  <li>
    I thought I thought of something else, but now I can't recall.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Triggers/Events/Related Actions/Find Good Term</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Use cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Voting. After all the individual vote cases are complete,
    the master workflow will look at the votes and determine whether to
    go to state Approved, Rejected, or Full Vote, or something else like
    that.
  </li>
  <li>
    After having received a document, the workflow automatically
    scans the document for the presence of certain words, and goes to
    one of two states depending on whether they were found or not.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Relating Tasks</h2>


<p> IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE TRIGGER/EVENT/WHATNOT STUFF ABOVE?</a>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Some process is triggered by typically a timer on an action being
  enabled. 
</p>



<h2>Relating Workflows/Cases</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
  Use cases:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    TIP Voting: There's a master workflow case for the TIP
    itself. When voting, there'll be a sub-workflow case for each TIP
    member to vote on the issue, with timeouts so if they don't vote
    within a week, their vote is automatically 'Abstained'.
  </li>
</ul>
