        The simulation package will nightly generate an XML file with information needed
        for the SIMBUILD flash map. The objects in the XML file will be those that are supposed
        to appear on the map, i.e. those that have the on_map_p attribute set to true. The file
        will only be regenerated if the contents of the file (i.e. the map objects) have changed
        since last time the file was generated. The object attributes stored in the XML file
        will be object id, name, url, thumbnail url, and description.
      </para>

        To activate this feature you need to specify the location of
        the XML file by visiting the configuration page of the package
        (start at the <ulink url="../">index page</ulink>) and setting
        the MapXMLFilePath parameter.
      </para>

      <para>
        You may view the XML file from a link on the <ulink
        url="../object-list">object list page</ulink> and you may also
        manually trigger the recreation of the XML file from there.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the <ulink url="../object-list">object list page</ulink>
        you may sign up for notifications for the Map XML file. You
        will then be notified by email everytime the XML file is
        regenerated (because something has changed) or everytime there
        is a problem generating the XML file.
