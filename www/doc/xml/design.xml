      <title>Notes on an object-oriented simulated space</title>
      <para>An OpenACS simulation is a collection of interactive
      objects, plus a set of roles and tasks.  In the first part, it
      is conceptually similar to a MOO (Multiple-User Dungeon,
      Object-Oriented).  This is a technology dating to 1990, in which
      a database of interactive objects is presented to users through
      a text interface.  MOOs, in turn, are based on MUDs
      (Multiple-User Dungeons), which are many years older.  More
      recently, MOOs have been supplanted by multi-million dollar
      commercial MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying
      Games), which are essentially MOOs with graphical instead of
      textual interfaces.  Given their lineage and success, it makes
      sense to draw on MOO technology when designing our simulation
      object model.</para>

There are three fundamental attributes to every object:

   1. A flag (either true or false) specifying whether or not the object represents a player,
   2. The object that is its parent, and
   3. A list of the objects that are its children; that is, those
   objects for which this object is their parent. </programlisting>

name         a string, the usual name for this object
owner        an object, the player who controls access to it
location     an object, where the object is in virtual reality
contents     a list of objects, the inverse of `location'
programmer   a bit, does the object have programmer rights?
wizard       a bit, does the object have wizard rights?
