There are three ways for a user to be enrolled in a
simulation:
<ul>
<li>You can set groups of users to be <b>automatically
enrolled</b> TODO: link to Tab 5?
<li>You can <b>invite</b> groups of users to join.  TODO: link to
whereever this is.
<li>You can allow <b>self-enrollment</b>
</ul>
<formtemplate id="simulation"></formtemplate>

<p>TODO B: When switching from open enrollment to "by invitation only" and back, the dates are lost -- see if we can avoid that.</p>
